- test inventory changes: out of stock, insufficient, unavailable
- test service unavailable: redis, kafka, inventory
- test every logic branches based on the flow chart

RESULT:

- stuck in development-phase, did not be able to test at all,
  but a question arise. What is the actual workflow, why am I trying to scale it at the very beginning
  => I need approach gradually
